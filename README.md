# RetinoVision
RetinoVision is a machine learning-based project designed to detect and classify the stages of diabetic retinopathy using retinal imaging. This project aims to support ophthalmologists in early diagnosis and intervention, leveraging advanced techniques in both traditional machine learning and deep learning.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Extracted essential features like microaneurysms and exudates from retinal images to enhance predictive accuracy.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and SVM, achieving a balanced precision-recall performance and robust accuracy.
Deep Learning Architecture: Experimented with Vision Transformers (ViT) to process retinal images, showcasing potential for scalable and efficient diagnosis.
Performance Insights: Evaluated model results using confusion matrices to analyze strengths and challenges in classification across severity levels.

This repository contains the implementation, dataset preprocessing steps, and evaluation results, along with detailed insights into the performance of various models. RetinoVision is a step toward improving diagnostic tools for diabetic retinopathy, enabling better clinical outcomes.
